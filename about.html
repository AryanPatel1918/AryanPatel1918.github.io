                üëã Hey there! I'm Aryan Patel, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at TMU (formerly Ryerson) actively pursuing a Co-op/Internship opportunity in Web/Software Development for Summer 2024.
                <br><br>
                üíº With a solid year of professional experience in the IT industry, I've honed my skills in web/software development. My programming toolkit includes expertise in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Perl, PHP, SQL, and more, positioning me as a versatile developer with a keen interest in solving complex problems.
                <br><br>
                üöÄ Passionate about continuous learning, I thrive in collaborative and constructive work environments. In my previous role as an IT Software QA Co-op at FGF Brands Inc, I had the opportunity to lead a comprehensive regression testing initiative, ensuring the stability of key applications throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Eager to leverage this experience, I am actively seeking a Summer 2024 Co-op/Internship in Information Technology, specifically in web/software development. 
                <br><br>
                üåê Committed to integrity, innovation, and collaboration, I guide my work with transparency and accountability. I believe in fostering a collaborative work environment, valuing diverse perspectives for collective success. My approach is not just about coding; it's about crafting solutions that make a meaningful impact.
                <br><br>
                üìà Always seeking opportunities for growth, I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills to a dynamic team. Let's connect and explore potential collaborations ‚Äì I'm open to discussing how my background and enthusiasm for technology align with your organization's goals!
